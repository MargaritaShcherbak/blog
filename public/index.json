You can learn a language up to the entry level in 6-10 months, but if you make a mistake with the choice, the language may become outdated, and you will lose time and money.\nTo track the demand for programming languages, companies make special ratings. The teacher of the online school of digital creativity and programming for children “Kodabra” Nikolay Vedernikov chose languages that occupy high places in the TIOBE and IEEE ratings. The first rating includes the languages in which the most lines of code are written, for the second they use a little more criteria. For example, popularity on job search sites, mentions in services for programmers and social networks.\nThe most popular programming languages:  Python C Java C++ C# JavaScript PHP R Arduino  Is it worth learning to program in Python Python is a logical and relatively simple language with a minimalistic syntax. He has a small set of basic rules, the language is easy to read and it is not difficult to write in it. Developers have written a lot of libraries for Python, so you can use ready-made solutions in your projects. The main disadvantage of Python is its low speed. Programs on it will run slower on average than in other languages.\nIn October 2021, Python became the most popular programming language, shifting from the first line of the ratings of Java and C.\nIs it worth learning C programming C is one of the oldest and most popular programming languages. It is “light” and fast, so it is used where high performance is needed. For example, to create drivers, operating systems or software for microcontrollers. At the same time, C is difficult to learn — you have to write a lot from scratch. If we compare programming languages with cars, then C is a racing car, inconvenient on city roads, but very fast.\nWhere they use it. With the help of C, drivers are created, operating system kernels are written, and libraries for Python and other languages are written.\nIs it worth learning to program in Java Java is a cross—platform language with a large number of libraries and a large community of developers. Cross—platform is the ability to write a program once and immediately use it on several operating systems: Windows, Linux and macOS. Thanks to Java libraries, it is suitable for almost everything: working with graphics, sound, creating small games. And in a large community, a novice developer can easily find ready-made pieces of code for different tasks and answers to almost any questions.\nIs it worth learning to program in C++ C++ is a cross—platform language of the C family with advanced functions.\nA huge number of programmers write code on it, share libraries and templates, answer questions from beginners.\nWhere they use it. Most often, operating systems, drivers and utilities are created in C++. They make popular desktop applications of the Adobe and Office series. Because of the high speed and performance, C++ is used to develop computer games. For example, the popular Unreal Engine is written on it.\nIs it worth learning to program in C# C# (c-sharp) is a language originally invented by Microsoft to create applications for Windows. It’s an object-oriented language — it’s harder to learn, but easier to use, for example, less writing the same code. Using C#, you can work with the WPF platform, which helps to create “beautiful” window applications. For example, the latest versions of MS Office.\nPHP PHP is used in web development to create programs that run on the server and help process client requests. PHP is gradually losing popularity because servers can be created using other languages. But many previously created sites still work in PHP, for example, VKontakte.\nIs it worth learning to program in R R is a language for data processing, statistics, and machine learning. R is constantly competing with Python, it is more often used in scientific research.\nIs it worth learning to program on Arduino Arduino is a simplified dialect of C++, in which only programs for Arduino controllers are written. But these controllers are used almost everywhere — from devices for automatic watering to full-fledged smart home systems and various robots.\nArduino exists only in conjunction with controllers, so it is not always considered a full-fledged language. To work on it, you need to buy a special board, connect it to a computer and use special software to write a program for the controller. But you can write a program, put the controller in the right device and immediately check how well it works.\n","date":1653436800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1653436800,"objectID":"375d8ec8c49ac2b31b548a6616a619a4","permalink":"https://example.com/post/language_speak/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/language_speak/","section":"post","summary":"A programming language is a formal language designed for writing computer programs.","tags":["Academic"],"title":"scientific programming languages","type":"post"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":" Click on the Slides button above to view the built-in slides feature.

Originally created in 2004 by John Gruber and Aaron Schwartz. Many language ideas have been borrowed from existing text markup conventions in emails. Markdown language implementations convert Markdown text into valid, correctly constructed XHTML and replace left angle brackets (\u0026#34;\u0026lt;\u0026#34;) and ampersands (\u0026#34;\u0026amp;\u0026#34;) with the corresponding object codes. The first implementation of Markdown was a Perl implementation written by Gruber, but after a while many implementations from third-party developers appeared (see below). The Perl implementation is distributed under a BSD type license. Markdown implementations in various programming languages are included (or available as a plugin) in many content management systems. You can use any text editor to write Markdown, but we recommend Visual Studio Code with the Docs Authoring Pack extension. The Doc Authoring Pack extension contains editing tools and preview functions that allow you to see how the articles on the Documentation site will look like. Alerts are a special Markdown extension that is used to create citation blocks displayed on the documentation site using colors and icons indicating the importance of the content.\nAvoid using the “Note”, “Advice”, “Important!”. Readers often miss them. It is recommended to place their information directly in the text of the article.\nIf you need to use alerts, limit yourself to one or two per article. Several notes should never be in an article next to each other. If angle brackets are used in the text of the file (for example, to indicate a placeholder), they need to be encoded manually. Otherwise, Markdown markup considers them HTML tags.\nAngle brackets do not have to be escaped in text formatted as embedded code or in code blocks. Although Markdown supports embedded HTML code, HTML is not recommended for publishing Documentation on the site. Any code, except for a limited list of values, will cause errors and warnings to appear during assembly.\n","date":1652227200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1652313600,"objectID":"a0ade9b4b218a8a455292eee739b86e8","permalink":"https://example.com/post/markdown/","publishdate":"2022-05-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/markdown/","section":"post","summary":"A post about a lightweight markup language","tags":["Academic"],"title":"Markdown","type":"post"},{"authors":["Margarita Romanovna Shcherbak"],"categories":["Demo"],"content":"Overview The structural elements of the report are:\n title page; list of performers; report; content; definitions; designations and abbreviations; introduction; the main part; conclusion; list of sources used; applications  Document design The pages of the report text and the illustrations and tables included in the report must comply with A4 format according to GOST 9327.

In classical version control systems, a centralized model is used, assuming a single repository for storing files. Most version control functions are performed by a special server. The project participant (user) receives the version of files he needs before starting work through certain commands.After making changes, the user places the new version in the repository. At the same time, previous versions are not deleted from the central repository and you can return to them at any time.The server can save the full version of the changed files, and produce the so-called data- compression—save only changes between successive versions, which reduces the amount of data stored. Version control systems support the ability to track and resolve conflicts that may arise when several people work on a single file.You can merge (merge) the changes made by different participants ( automatically or manually), manually select the desired version, cancel the changes altogether or lock the files for modification. Depending on the settings, the lock does not allow other users to get a working copy or prevents the change a working copy of the file by means of the OS file system, thus providing privileged access to only one user working with the file. Version control systems can also provide additional, more flexible functionality.For example, they can support working with multiple versions of a single file, keeping a general history of changes up to the point of branching versions and their own change histories of each branch.Moreover, information is usually available about which of the participants, when and what changes were made.The usual this kind of information is stored in the change log, access to which can be restricted. Unlike the classical ones, in distributed version control systems, a central repository is not mandatory. Among the classic Venture capitalists, the most famous are CV, Subversion, and among the distributed ones - Git, Bazaar, Mercurial. The principles of their work are similar, they differ mainly in the syntax of the commands used in the work.\n","date":1651622400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1651795200,"objectID":"616b6c864122c5074e203959e9f02124","permalink":"https://example.com/post/versioning/","publishdate":"2022-05-04T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/versioning/","section":"post","summary":"A version control system is a software to facilitate working with changing information.","tags":["Academic"],"title":"Git Version Control","type":"post"},{"authors":["Margarita Romanovna Shcherbak"],"categories":["Demo"],"content":"Overview Last week I did lab work on operating systems and information technology.
