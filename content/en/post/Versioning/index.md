## Overview

Version control systems (Version Control System, VCS) are used when working with several
people under a project.The
usual main tree of the project is stored in a local or remote repository to which access is configured for project participants.When
making changes to the content of the project, the version control system allows
you to fix them, combine changes made by different project participants,
roll back to any earlier version of the project, if required.
In classical version control systems, a centralized model is used,
assuming a single repository for storing files.
Most version control functions are performed by a special server.
The project participant (user)
receives the version of files he needs before starting work through certain commands.After making changes, the user
places the new version in the repository. At the same time, previous versions are not deleted
from the central repository and you can return to them at any time.The server can
save the full version of the changed files, and produce the so-called data-
compressionâ€”save only changes between successive versions, which
reduces the amount of data stored.
Version control systems support the ability to track and resolve
conflicts that may arise when several people work on a single
file.You can merge (merge) the changes made by different participants (
automatically or manually), manually select the desired version, cancel the changes altogether
or lock the files for modification. Depending on the settings, the lock does not
allow other users to get a working copy or prevents the change
a working copy of the file by means of the OS file system, thus
providing privileged access to only one user working with the file.
Version control systems can also provide additional, more flexible
functionality.For example, they can support working with multiple
versions of a single file, keeping a general history of changes up to the point of branching
versions and their own change histories of each branch.Moreover,
information is usually available about which of the participants, when and what changes were made.The usual
this kind of information is stored in the change log, access to which can be restricted.
Unlike the classical ones, in distributed version control systems, a central
repository is not mandatory.
Among the classic Venture capitalists, the most famous are CV, Subversion, and among the distributed
ones - Git, Bazaar, Mercurial. The principles of their work are similar, they differ mainly
in the syntax of the commands used in the work.
