## Overview

3 years ago, I went with my family to rest in Thailand. To the city of Pattaya. It's very nice and hot there. Very stuffy. The locals, of course, got used to such a climate and such weather, but it was uncomfortable for us. However, surprisingly, there are a lot of Russian people living in this country. We were vacationing at the hotel and our room was on the 27th floor. On the 30th floor there was a swimming pool with an open view of the city. Unrealistically beautiful views. We hardly left the hotel because it was hot. It was cool in the hotel. We were all burned on the second day of rest. There were blisters on the shoulders, nose, chest. The sensations were not very good. It is necessary to use sunscreens, and we neglected this. My aunt even got a sunstroke and lay with a fever for about three days, but she was cared for by the staff, and she quickly got back on her feet. We also went on excursions. The most memorable is a trip to Cambodia. Visiting temples in the jungle. Elephant riding. Waterfalls. Villages on the water. It was very interesting. I recommend everyone to visit such a wonderful country as Thailand!
