## Overview

Last week I was doing lab work on operating systems. She also conducted the 3rd stage of the individual project. Posted information about her achievements, skills and experience. I wrote two posts. On Saturday, I went to information technology classes. Also in the evening I visited the HPP-2 exhibition. I got a lot of beautiful photos from there. There is a very beautiful birch grove there. On Sunday, I was doing laboratory work on operating systems number 9.
