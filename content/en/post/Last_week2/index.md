## Overview

Last week, a serious holiday was celebrated - May 9. I accompanied the immortal regiment as a volunteer. This day was very busy and responsible. The weather changed a lot during the day, then rain, then hail, then the sun with clouds. However, this did not prevent the festive mood. That week I also did lab work on operating systems. It wasn't easy. The week as a whole was busy, but productive. I've handled everything. On the evening of May 9, I went to the fireworks on Poklonnaya Gora. It was great there. There were a lot of people. However, it didn't hurt. The fireworks were long, bright and impressive. I also met new people that evening. They were very joyful and persistent. After the fireworks, I went home on foot to enjoy Moscow at night. Moscow is beautiful! I enjoyed life.
