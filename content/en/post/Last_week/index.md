## Overview

Last week I did lab work on operating systems and information technology. It was not easy, but I completed everything on time. It's quite interesting and informative. My whole week was busy studying. This week I created a template for a personal website! It's very cool actually. I was engaged in physical culture and taught English. I also went to volunteer training on May 9th.
