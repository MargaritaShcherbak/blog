## Overview

Last week I did laboratory work on operating systems, did an individual project stage 4, attached links to scientific and bibliometric resources. She also wrote a test paper on programming technology. On Saturday, I did laboratory work on a computer workshop on information technology. On Sunday, I devoted a day to myself, rested mentally and physically. I walked, enjoyed life, nature, the sun. The weather was wonderful! Spring pleases and warms.
