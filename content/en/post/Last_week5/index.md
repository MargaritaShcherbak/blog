## Overview

Last week I was doing lab work on operating systems. I went to classes in programming technology. On Saturday I went to information technology classes and completed 6 laboratory works. It remains only to issue reports. It is always very interesting and pleasant when the work turns out. On a day off (Sunday) I've been watching movies. I started watching the series. Last week was the last lesson in physical education and English. I'm waiting for the results.
