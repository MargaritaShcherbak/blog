3. Wrote 2 posts: 
- for the past week
- on the topic of git version control
 (Fig .[-@fig:003] - Fig.[-@fig:007])

In the work/blog/content/post folder, we created two folders: Last_week for a post on the past week and Versioning for a post on the topic "Version Control. Git". 
We copy the md file from the getting-started folder and paste this file into our two created folders. 
Then we edit this file in the same folder in accordance with the topic of the post.
